# AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam -Notes

## What is CloudFront?

* Content delivery Network to reduce load on main server
* Bring content near to the customer which reduces latency and increases performance
* It can handle both static and Dynamic content

### Important Terms in Cloudfront

1. Origin - the place where the content is originally hosted
2. Distribution - it is place you configure where to distributed this content. It is *kind of* configuration file send to the edge location
3. Edge Location - is under distribution.
4. Regional Edge Location - is big brother of Edge location. So user look for a content and did not found that one edge location, then before the request goes to the Origin (origin fetch), the content is checked at Regional Edge location. The regional edge location, the distribute this content to the edges in its region.
5. With ACM (AWS Certificate manager), we can make static website secure (ssl)
6. You cannot upload the object to Cloudfront. Remember S3 transfer acceleration?

#### Cloud Front Optimization guidelines

* query string Parameters could be set Forward to origin Yes or No
* If you have a content which is unique per region/location e.g. Language then would make sense to cache this content specific to region and the query string should include this parameter. If this parameter is not include then request goes to Origin and item could be wrongly cached
* This is extremly important to understand what content to cache and what queries should be send to origin.
* Query string parameter must match for every query send by the requestor. Please review the video. It is worth the time.
* If your application do not use query string parameters, then disable the "forward to origin"
* But if your application uses it, then you can either all or select the specific query

## AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

* only for supported AWS Services/Products e.g. ELB and Cloudfront.
* EC2 it is not possible e.g. you deploy a webserver on ec2, you cannot attached certificate via ACM
* Also, communication between Cloudfront and Origin if required to be https, then certificate must be signed, it cannot be self signed.
