# Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

Reference: [AWS SAA Course from Adrian](https://learn.cantrill.io/) 

* every time you launch instance, you use AMI without knowing it.
* AMI can AWS provided or community based
* But we can get AMI from commerical market place e.g. AMI with 3rd party license. Here the cost model is different
* This is important, AMI are specific to region. This means AMI can be same or different per region. Irrespective of that, AMI are defined by AMI IDs and will be unique per Region
* By Default AMI are private, but you either make it public, assign it to AWS accounts. These permissions associated with AMI.
* You can always create AMI instance from the Instance e.g. you install wordpress on the EC2- instance, then you create a AMI out of it. 
* AMI ID is purely container, it has only block device mapping table reference the device IDs.
* AMI cannot be edited. (if you are coming from vmware background it might confused you, but it is same as updating template. In order to patch the OS, you convert the template to VM and patch it and convert back to template)
* AMI is not free you are billed for the snapshots associated with the AMI. But remember EBS costs only for space consumed and not allocated space.
* AMI should be always created (**recommended**) when the instance is powered off.
