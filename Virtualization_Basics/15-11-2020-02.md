# Storage in AWS

## Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

* It is block storage (can be mounted) and it is primarily used for Booting OS
* It is AZ resilient
* Different Storage Types & Characteristics
  * HDD
  * SSD
  * IOPS
  * Throughput
* It is charged GB/month

### Disk types

* General Purpose **SSD** (GP2) - *focus IOPS*
  * **Baseline Performance**: 3 IOPS/GiB, 16,000 Max IOPS (minimum 100 IOPS), this is per Volume
  * **Limits**: Maximum volume size 16 TiB. Throughput: 250 MiB/s. **With Nitro**, you 80,000 IOPS  and 2375 MB/s _**per instance**_
* Provisioned IOPS **SSD** (io1) - *focus IOPS*
  * **Baseline Performance**: 50:1 IOPS ratio compared (3:1), 64000 Max IOPS, 1000 MiB/s
  * Per instance: 2375 MB/s, 80,000 IOPS
  * use case: latency sensititive Databases
  * Multi-attach feature.
* Throughput Optimized **HDD** (st1) - *focus Throughput* [remember T is for throughput]
  * **Baseline Performance**: 40 MB/s per TiB, 250 MB/s burst and maximum 500 MB/s
* Cold **HDD** (sc1) - *focus throughput* [remember c is for Cold]
  * **Basline Performance**: 12 MB/s per TiB, 80 MB/s burst and max 250 MB/s

#### Common characteristics of ST1 and SC1

* minimum size 500 GiB till 16 TiB
* Not for boot volume

##### Use cases

* Read and Write Large Block sizes in sequential way
* Media processing, large throughput, no Random IOs
* Big data, data warehouse, log processing or anything which has sequential access patterns
