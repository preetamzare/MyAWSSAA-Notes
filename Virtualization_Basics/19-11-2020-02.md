# Instance Checks and Auto Recovery

Reference: [AWS SAA Course from Adrian](https://learn.cantrill.io/) 

Two types of Instance checks

## System Status Check (EC2 host checks)

* loss of system power
* loss of network connectivity
* host software and hardware issues
  
## Instance status checks (EC2 Instance Checks)

* Corrupted File System
* Incorrect Instance Networking
* OS Kernel Issues

## Auto Recovery

* You can create Alarm which can trigger alarm to restart the system by using "Create Status check alarm"
* Action could be
  * restart
  * stop
  * terminate
  * recover
* works on limited Mordern Instance
* do not work when you have instance store configured
* may not work if there is capacity issue on EC2 host


# Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

* Vertical scaling considerations
  * monolithic application
  * but may cost you premium as you increase the size and remember there is always a upper limit
  * vertical scaling requires a disruption
* Horizontal scaling
  * less expensive
  * no disruptions to the application as long as application support offload sessions
  * Requires application support as you need a load balancer in front of it.
  * There is lot of options to scale granularly.

# Instance Metadata

* is the data about the instance.
* http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
* information about
  * Networking e.g. IPv4 Public address, Instance AZ Location
  * User-data
  * Authentication
* do remember this information is available to anyone who has access to the EC2 instance. You can block it using iptables
* meta is neither encrypted nor authenticated.
