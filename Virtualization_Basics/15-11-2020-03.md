## Instance Store

* Non-persistent by nature.
* Can be attached only during the launch
* Block storage, only attached to EC2 host
* Highest performance of all in AWS
* As long as instance is on same Host, instance store data is not lost, but instance can move to different host under following conditions
  * Host undergoes maintenance
  * instance is stopped and started (normally happen when you resize EC2 instance)
* No of instance volumes you get and size & Performance of Instance depends upon size of EC2 instance you select
  * some support HDD, SSD and NVE
  * Price is included in the instance price.

## Comparing instance Store and EBS

EBS | Instance Store
--- | --------------
Performance requirement is below 60,000 IOPS or 2375 MiB/S | Performance requirement is above
Persistent Storage which is non-replaceable | non-persistent Storage (but high performance, which can be discarded or ignored after processing)
Additional Costs | comes free of cost assuming you are selecting right instance type
Database files can kept on EBS | tempDB can be kept here
You can take a backup using snapshot | Is it possible here (?)
Multi-attach feature (io1) | Multi-attach Not possible
