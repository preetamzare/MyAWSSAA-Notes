# 06-11-2020 AWS SAA Exam Notes -Part B

Though this file is done on same day, I have divided this in to parts to read easier.

Reference: [AWS Training from Adrain](https://learn.cantrill.io/)

## DynamoDB Architecture

* First and foremost, it is no-SQL database key/value database.
* It is Wide-column database.
* Considered as $true DBaaS Product. It is public service.You only have to manage database and not database servers like Amazon RDS or Aurora
* It is regional service i.e. it is by default HA across AZ, data is automatically replicated across the Zones

> But remember you have to handle this manually for RDS

> If remember from earlier lesson DynamoDB is one of the product which can utilize what is called as VPC GW Endpoint.

* Keywords:
  * Low latency
  * Automatic Backup and Point in Time Recovery
  * Data at rest encryption
  * event driven architecture (in other words invoke Lamda function for specific event)

* There are two types of keys available
  * Partition key
  * Composite Key is combination of (Partition Key + Sort Key) 
* So, this means - every item in the table must have unique PK or unique PK and SK
* Items in the table can have attributes over and above PK
* Items can have no attributes, mixture of attributes or completely different attributes. In short, no rigid attribute structure

There are two methods you can provision tables

* Provisioned Capacity (Capacity = RCU = 4 KB/s, WCU = 1 KB/s)
* On-Demand Capacity (Capacity = RCU = 4 KB/s, WCU = 1 KB/s)

### Backup and Restore

* Manual Backup
  * Purpose is to migrate across region.
  * you can restore table with or without index
  * you should manage this backup, this backup has no infinite retention period
* Automatic Backup
  * Allow Point in time restore
  * You must enable this backup per Table
  * RPO=1 sec for last 35 days
