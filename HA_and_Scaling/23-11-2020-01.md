## Why we need a load balancer ?

* Now, with DNS Multivalue plus Health checks everything should work. But following does not work
  * There is no intelligence e.g. any of the web server will get more request. In short load distribution cannot happen. May be the "", it is possible but then this does not scale well especially because of DNS Cache
  * Second there is very critical issue which DNS cannot do and it is session management. This is THE most important.
  * Third, Load Balancer cannot do health checks for you, DNS cache problem will not be there at all. Load balancer will redirect the requests

### Important Terms

* Listener: The one who listens at specific port. So the load balancer is always listening at specific port, URL and etc
* Endpoint user/device do not connect to the server but to the Load balancer
* Targets are actually the server behind the load balancer. It is load balancer job to connect to the individual server. Lamda could be one of the example.
* Load balancer enhanced High availability, Fault Tolerance and Scaling.

## Application Load balancer (ALB)

* Layer 7, this means it is capable detect data which passes through them.
* ALB can take actions based on it
  * Path
  * headers
  * hosts
* ALB is high available across the AZ, as long as you configured it correctly
* Internet facing or internal load balancer
* Costing
  * Hourly Rate
  * Load Balancer Capacity Unit
* Cross Zone load balanced is enabled by default
* when you create security group, you also define each entities can reach load balancer. So in short, Security groups are defined at load balancer level (as well)

### Rules, Targets and Groups

* Targets can be EC2 Instance, Lambda or ECS/Containers, HTTPS, HTTP/2 (?) and Websockets
* Targets are grouped together to form Target Group. Targets can be part of multi-groups
* ALB distributes connect to Target Groups
* Rules
  * Rules are applied to the target groups.
  * rules can be path based or host based
  * host based rules can distributed the traffic based on multiple DNS names
  * SNI provides the functionality of multiple SSL Certs, there by gives us opportunity to consolidate the number of classical load balancers.

## Launch Configurations and Templates

* Both are same. Both cannot be edit. Launch Template is now recommended to use by AWS
* With Launch template, there is possibility of versioning
* These are the configuration which you do in advance and the Auto scaling will use this information to **automatically** launch the instance
* Things you can configure in Launch Templates/Configuration
  * AMI, AMI Instance type
  * Storage
  * Keypair
  * Network ACL (?) and Security Group
* In Launch templates you additional features
  * Placement groups
  * capacity reservations
  * Elastic Graphics
  * you can also use Launch Template to deploy instance from command line also
