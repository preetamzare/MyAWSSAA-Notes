## Auto scaling group

* Launch templates and Launch Configurations are inputs or the configurations items which tells Auto scaling group how and where to provisioning the EC2 instance
* They can also self heal EC2 instances
* Most important terms are
  * Minimum Capacity
  * Desired Capacity - this is the default no of instances, Auto scaling group will always try to provision.
  * Maximum Capacity
* You can either manually defined this or can use auto scaling policies.
* Auto scaling polices use defined metrics e.g. CPU utilization to make this decision
* :magnet: Auto Scaling groups are linked to the VPC.
* Auto Scaling groups can be launched either from Launch configuration or from the specific version of the template

### Scaling Policies

* Types are
  1. Manual
  2. Schedule Scaling: sales periods - it is best suited
  3. Dynamic Scaling
     * Simple : CPU above 50% add one instance and reverse
     * Stepped Scaling: CPU above 50% add 3 instance, and when CPU above 80% add 6 instance and reverse. It is more like fast reaction and in steps not gradual reaction.
     * Target Tracking: This is like establishing a baseline for your application and ensuring the Auto Scaling group sticks to it. e.g. if you define all your server should be avg 40% utilized. Then Auto scaling group either adds or removes the instance to maintain 40% utilization.
  4. Cool down period - is a period which should pass before Auto Scaling group starts reacting to the policies. This will avoid unnecessary auto scaling in and out actions
  5. Auto scaling groups also have self-healing function. That is, when they can detect if the instance has failed and easily recovered. 
  6. Auto scaling group will try to develop even number of instance across availability zone
  7. When you integrate load balancer with ASG, then you can also control the number of instances added or removed to Targetgroup based on the policy.
  8. ASG defines when and where instances are launched and Launch Template/Configuration defined what is launched.
  9. "What" could be elephant, ant? You define elephants or ants in the Launch template
  10. Where could be river/lake (technically speak which subnet (AZ)) and when could be day or night

#### Additional Information

* You have to attached instance profile (IAM role) to the Launch Templates. Because it is executed via ASG, ASG needs permission to launch instance
* When you integrate Load balancer with Auto Scaling Group, you integrate it with the Target group

## Network Load Balancer (L4)

* Upto L4, TCP/UDP and Ports. 
* More higher you go, slow the performance is.
* NLB has 100 ms latency, but ALB has 400 ms latency
* When https traffic inspection is not required, then NLB is the default option.
* Keywords:
  * Whitelisting at Firewall
  * static IP/Elastic IP
  * High performance
  * load balance non-http/https traffic
  * SSL Pass through

## SSL Offload - ELB

It is all about where the SSL termination will (if it is going to happen)
There are three modes available

1. Bridging Mode (default)
2. Pass Through
3. SSL offload

### Bridging mode

* SSL certificate is required to be placed on ELB, SSL certificate private key is also required to be on ELB
* SSL certificate is also required on target (end points, EC2 instance) and computation is required to be on endpoints
* Second and new SSL connection is established between ELB and endpoint. This is important.
* But in case, you wish to use ELB then with Cloud HSM you can achieve this.

### Pass through

* highly secure but then ELB is of little use here. You should instead use NLB
* no certificate on ELB/NLB. Hence no decryption happen and no intelligence of ELB can be used to do session management

### SSL Offload

* it is more or less same as Bridging mode except that no new SSL connection is established between ELB and Targets
* In this case, traffic from ELB to Targets is in plain text.

## Stickness

* Not much here. Keep session management outside of EC2 instance
* You can use DynamoDB to retain the session
* Also there can be uneven load balancing when Session cookie stays on EC2. So when using load balancer, keep the session management outside and not on target.
