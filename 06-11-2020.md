### Elastic Cache

* Critical Part for designing High performance system
* In-Memory Database (wondering why it is called Elastic cache?)
* Two Engines
  * Memcache
  * Redis

Difference between Memcache and Redis

Memcache  | Redis
----------|----------
simple data structure | advanced data structure
No Multi AZ, HA | Multi AZ and HA
No Backup ups | Backup and restore
Multi thread & therefore Multi-core aware | Strict consistency

#### Use cases

* Read Heavy
* Low Latency
* Reduces cost, RCU are less
* Storing Session Data

#### Considerations

* need application change :roll_eyes: :bangbang:

### Amazon Redshift

* Simple words a Dataware House (DWH) Solution
* DWH databases are always OLAP (online analytic processing) and NOT OLTP
* It is column database, it helps in reporting
* OLAP always gets data from OLTP for analysis
* Redshift is delivered as Service same as RDS. Remember RDS, we get EC2 instance though we cannot access them.
* Redshift spectrum - read the data directly in to S3. This reduces the time to copy data into Redshift. Remember we are normally talking here TBs of data.
* Also features federated identity
* Remember Athena is adhoc thing, but DWH cannot be.
* Redshift is basically cluster but it is restricted to single AZ. Unless you configure it otherwise. (Do we configure across AZ?)
* Redshift cluster has
  * Leader nodes and compute node. So compute node does the computing but it is leader node who decides who does the computing.
  * Compute node is further divides into slice and each slice gets Memory and Disk space
  * slice can be 2,4,16 or 32 slices
  * Enchanced VPC Routing means private access to Redshift. Because by default it is using public routes
  * Few ways Redshift cluster protects your data
    * one copy of the data to another node in the cluster
    * **Automatic** Backups happens to S3 every 8 hours or 5 GB
    * Since S3 is Regional Service it is automatically available across AZ
    * also possible to take snapshot of backup across the Region but it is manual
* Redshift cluster can be populated with data using 
  * S3
  * DynamoDB
  * database migration service
  * Kinesis Firehose
