# 07-11-2020 AWS SAA Exam Notes -Part D

Reference: [AWS Training from Adrain](https://learn.cantrill.io/)

## Shared Responsibility Model

:bangbang: Do not quote me for this

* AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud
* You as customer is responsible for the security ***in the cloud***
* AWS responsible for the security of Region, AZ and edge locations
* When you consume a AWS service, then AWS responsible for the
  * security
  * and Provisioning that service including HA (if available and required for the given service)
* EC2 example is shared by Adrian
  * AWS own Storage, compute, Networking and Platform
  * You own, anything over and above OS 
  * e.g. patching OS, Encryption and OS Hardening, FW configuration
  * any data and configuration in the OS
* Refer to SharedResponsability2.png in the learning aid section. It is must to refer.

## High Availbility

* High availabiltiy is associated with Uptime. So, try to remember that HA is focused in increasing uptime. It is about fast and if possible automatic recovery of system
* Fault Tolerant systems are designed to **work or operatate even if there are** failure and faults
* When HA and FT do not work, then you need to think of DR
* DR is designed to keep crucial and non-replaceable part of your system safe so that when DR occurs, you do not lose anything irreplaceble and can rebuild after the disaster.

## DNS Basics 101

### Key terms
  
* Zone e.g. amazon.com is zone. So, www is dns record in the amazon.com zone
* amazon.com is saved as zone file on server. This server is called NameServer (NS)
* DNS Resolver -(can i called it DNS Server?).
* DNS Client ask DNS Resolver when it needs to find www.amazon.com
* DNS NameServer (NS) is the one which hosts the zone or hosts this zone file.
* I can say DNS Client --> DNS Resolved --> DNS NameServer
* **DNS Root** is hosted on 13 special name servers known as Root Servers. These are not 13 in numbers, there can more one servers e.g. clustered and can be distributed globally. So these are represented by single entity. These Servers are managed by 12 different large Global organizations. **remember servers are managed but DNS as application/services is NOT MANAGED**. Verisign manages two of such servers.
* Root hints - a file which has list of all 13 root servers.
* Root Zone is managed by IANA. Try to think this as Root Zone as service is managed by IANA. Root Zone or more specifically the root zone file has top level domains entry which are .com, .org, .edu. To say precisely, IANA only host these root zones on these 13 servers.
* Authorative - think of this as Trust. e.g. there is one server which is authorative for root server and there is another server which is authorative for amazon.com
* Delegation - is also a thing associated with Trust. By delegation, you say server B is also authorative for amazon.com zone
* TLD refers to Top Level Domain, GTLD (Generic Top Level Domain), CCTLD
* Country TLD e.g. UK is delegated to Registries. These are the one who manages specific TLDs. This means they are responsible for creating zones in specific TLDs. e.g. .com is delegated to verisign.

### Route53 Fundamental


* It has two important concept. Public hosted Zone and Private hosted Zone. 
* But before that what is hosted zone?
  
> A hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain, such as amazon.com, and its subdomains.

* Private Hosted Zone are associated with VPC. There are some details, I would suggest you review the lesson directly.
* Route53 can register a domain for you and host a zone for you. Remember these are two different things.
* DNS Records available in Route53
  * A and AAAA 
  * CNAME can only point to A record and no other record.
  * MX Record for Mails
  * Text record to prove your ownership for the domain
  * Text record is also used to fight email spams. It authorize who/which entities are allowed to send email on your behalf
* TTL Value
  * Higher TTL value means less load on DNS Server
  * Lower TTL value means high load on DNS Server.
  * Always lower the TTL value well before in advance before you change DNS record. This makes sure you have less caching issue.
