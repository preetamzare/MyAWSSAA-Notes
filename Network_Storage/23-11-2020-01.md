## Elastic File System (EFS)

* Ok, when I first read it, i assume it is EBS. But it is NFS implemented on v4.0
* NFS can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances
* NFS cannot be used on Windows. We have different solution for this. So this is just for Linux
* EFS is private service and provisioned in the VPC of your choice. But you can use when you implement hybrid technologies like VPC Peering or Direct Attached.
* By Default, EFS is not highly available (as NAT GW), you need to deploy them in individual AZ using something called as mount targets
  * In the Mount Targets you specify
    * AZ
    * Subnet ID
    * Optionally IP Address
    * Security Group
* As in EBS, the following performance modes are available
  * General Purpose - default for most use cases
  * Max I/O (read IO1) - focused on throughput but high latency
* Like S3, these are storage classes
  * Standard
  * Infrequent Access (IA)
  * Lifecycle Policies can be used with classes
* We have throughput mode
  * which is bursting or provisioned
  * bursting is default and best in most cases
  * in provisioned you can choose the throughput as per your requirement independent of size.
* Default settings
  * Automatic backup
  * Data at rest encryption (KMS is automatically created)

### Additional Information

* You need additional EFS util package to be installed on EC2 instance to connect to EFS
* When mounting EFS inside EC2 instance, you just need File System ID
