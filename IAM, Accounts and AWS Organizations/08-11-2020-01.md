## IAM Identity Policies

* Policies are attached to the IAM Identities
* IAM Identitiy Policies are also referred as Policy Document
* Written in JSON
* Structure of policy document is
  * Statement01 {}, Statement02 {}
  * statement defines what is allowed or denied on specific resource
  
```JSON
  {
     statementid: nameofthestatement (optional field)
     Action: (list of actions allowed e.g. read, write, start and stop)
     Resource: (where these actions are required to performed)
     Effect: (whether to allow or deny)
     }
```

> thing you should note is, action is not allow or deny. Try to remembeer Action = Access. Effect = Permission.

You can use wildcards in Resources and Action
### Golden Rules of IAM Policies

* Explicit denies always Wins. Nothing can override it.
* When there is neither explictly allow or deny on the resource, it is always denied

### IAM Identities

* Users, groups and Roles (this is most to remember)
* When you need a long term access, when you need interaction with the resource and when you need a service to act on behalf of you (service account), then think of IAM User
* Remember the term "Authenticated Identity" - Identity which is authenticated.

### IAM Policies

* Managed Policy - policy defined can be used by multiple identities. Low management overhead
* Inline Policy - specific identity and cannot be reused. These are used as execptional allow or deny policies e.g. deny on specific resource for specific identity.
* AWS Managed Policy - kind of standard templates
* Customer Managed Policy - customised to meet your requirements. You create it and therefore you manage it.
