## DynamoDB Global Tables

* Multimaster replication with Cross region replication.

:headphones: Cross region replication means Global and Multimaster means more than one writer

* Reads and Write can occur in any region but :headphones: strong consistency only in same region, but eventual consistency globally :globe_with_meridians: .
* The last writer wins, if there is conflict

### Use Cases

* High availability across :globe_with_meridians:
* Diaster Recovery across :globe_with_meridians:
* Near Zero RPO and RTO
* Suitable for Stocks markets like business domain in the same region (_which are normally in same region_) 

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

* It is in-Memory :muscle: cache for DynamoDB
* Allows application to directly interact with Cache via **DAX SDK**
* DAX is designed for DynamoDB
* DAX is deployed in VPC. But DynamoDB is public Service. Keep this in Mind ðŸ§ 
* It is deployed in multiple AZ and act as cluster (DAX Cluster)
  * Master node (writer and reader)
  * read node (reading)
  * applications can use DAX Cluster endpoint to access cache
  * DAX cluster can be scaled up and down
* DAX Maintains two types of cache
  * **Item Cache** -retrieved via getitem or batchgetitem. Data is retreived using Primary and if available via Sort key
  * **Query Cache** - collection of items retreived via Query or scan operations.
  
  Remember the concept of Write-through. Here write request is send to DAX Primary Node (Read and Writer) and DynamoDB. Write request at DAX helps in caching data and hence cache miss is reduced.

### Use cases

* Heavy Reads :ok_hand:
* Bursty workloads (seasonal workload) :ok_hand:
* Cost reduction especially RCU value can be reduced :metal:
* But not suitable :thumbsdown:
  * For strong read consistency e.g. Stock market databases
  * For Heavy Writes
