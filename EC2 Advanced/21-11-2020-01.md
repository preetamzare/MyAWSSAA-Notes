# AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam -Notes

Revised On: 17.12.2020

## Dedicated Hosts

* EC2 host is allocated to your account
* designed for specific EC2 Instance (not all)
* You pay for the host capacity and NOT for the no of instances running on them
* You can pay on demand, reserve the capacity (1 or 3 years) or i would say same options are available as EC2 instance (full payment, partial payment)

### Considerations

* RHEL, Windows (?) and SUSE Linux AMI are **unsupported**
* Placement groups are unsupported
* You can mix the instance type only on Nitro EC2 hosts
* Amazon RDS is unsupported
* BUT you can share the host with other AWS accounts.
  * So when you own the host, you see all EC2 instance created by you and other AWS Accounts. But you cannot control the instances created by other AWS accounts.
  * But the other AWS Account can see only the instance created
* Software licensing e.g. VMware makes a strong use case for dedicated hosts

### Enchanced Networking

* SRIOV = enhanced networking
* Required for Cluster Placement groups
* Consistent Low Latency
* Low CPU Utilization and Higher I/O
* Higher Packets per seconds (PPS)
* Available on most EC2 types

### EBS Optimized

* Dedicated networking for EBS. Initially/Without EBS this is like network and data is flowing on same NIC
* It is enabled by Default, so it is included in the price.
* In older instance, if enabled, it costs extra
* You need EBS optimized when you are selecting IO1 or gp2
