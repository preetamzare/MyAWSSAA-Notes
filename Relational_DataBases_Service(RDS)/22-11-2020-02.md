## Databases on EC2

### :toolbox: Use cases

 When you may need database on EC2

* Database is not available on AWS (Niche database)
* Database and OS combination is unavailable on AWS
* You or application owner needs either access to the database or OS itself
* Specific Architecture - replication, HA not available within AWS

### Limitation/consideration of Database on EC2

* Admin overhead in managing EC2 and database
* Backup inside the OS for database so the backup should be database aware
* EC2 and EBS are AZ resilient
* Replication needs database specific features to be enabled (e.g. log shipping or replication)
* Performance or optimization of both EC2 and Database needs special skills.

## Relational Database Service (RDS)

* It is not Database as a Service (DBaaS), because here unit of consumption is not database but database server
* So it EC2 instance with database installed on it and <ins>Managed by AWS</ins>.
  * To further emphasis this part, DB comes in db.m5 (general purpose), db.r5 (ram), db.t3 (burst), which is same as EC2 except that they are appended with **db**.
* Aurora is AWS's RDS offering.
* All popular databases are supported (you may call them database engine)
* It is like
  * database engine
    * then database instance on it (you can create one while provisioning, additional afterwards)
      * then tables inside the database
* CNAME refers to the name you can use to access the database (you cannot use IP Address)
* You can use the same tools to manage the database as you would do while manage these database on premises or on ec2-instance. e.g. to manage MS SQL database, you can use SSMS
* RDS by default is AZ Resilient service. For High availability you need AZ Resilient i.e.Multi-AZ
* With RDS, comes EBS and with EBS comes
  * GP2
  * IO1
  * Magnetic (it is purely there for compatibility reason,which are configured historically on magnetic disk)
* You have to pay for storage. The cost model is same as EBS which is GB/month
* To access RDS instance, you need Security group. The Security group is assigned to the RDS instance.

### Steps to create RDS

* First, you create a subnet group. The Subnet group needs
  * VPC
    * AZ
      * subnet in the AZ
* Second, security group for the RDS
  * You create a security group in the VPC of your choice
  * In that security group, you can inbound rule, to allow port 3306 for the security group where your EC2 instances are running.
* Third, create RDS Instance with following settings
  * Database Engine - MariaDB and its version
  * Templates e.g. Production, development or test and Free tier
  * DB Instance Identifier - (what is this?)
  * DB Instance Size
  * Storage Type
  * Database administrator
  * Connectivity - VPC, Subnet group
  * AZ Preference (this is same as EC2 thing, if you remember)
  * database name
  * there are many other options, no described here. So not covering.
