## Simple Storage Services Basics

* Regional Service and regionally resilient. This means - data is replicated across AZ by AWS. You do not have to configure it.
* It is public service
* What can you storage in S3? (short answer almost anything), more technical answer
  * movies
  * audio distributions
  * Stock images
  * data from IoT devices
* Ways to access S3
  * CLI
  * API (make a mental note)
  * GUI
  * Http 
* Think of it as default storage for anything in AWS
* You must de-select "Block Public Access" or the Bucket policy would not work. This is visible in "Access" colums of S3 Bucket. It states "Objects can be public"

### Objects and Buckets

* Buckets are containers for objects
* Objects have Keyvalue pair
  * Key identifies the object in the bucket
  * value is basically is data e.g. animal.jpg or **content of the Object**
  * So to access the object in a bucket, you need a key  
* Buckets have flat structure. Not tree like structure. Folder means nothing here. They become part of object identification path
* There is no concept of filetype
* Try to remember that folders are prefix
* ARN stands for AWS Resource Name
  * arn::aws::s3:::bucketname. Now here aws is partition and s3 is service name. Since the bucketname is unique globally, you do not have to provide other details hence it is ":::"
  * while applying IAM Policies always remember there difference between 1 and 2 as stated below
  * arn::aws::s3:::pascal01 - access to the bucket but nothing inside the bucket.
  * arn::aws::s3:::pascal01/* - access to the all objects inside the bucket but not bucket itseff
  
#### Buckets naming conventions

* small cases only
* unique names globally
* 3 - 63 characters
* no underscores
* must start with number or lowercase
* No IPAddress like convention 1.1.1.1

### Size and Limits of S3

* value of the object e.g. animal.jpg can be up to 5 TB is size
* Buckets can hold **unlimited** number of objects.
* soft limit of 500 Buckets, 1000 Hard limit per AWS Account
* S3 is not file Storage. This means you cannot browse the file system as you do in OS
* S3 is also not a block storage. This means you cannot the S3 storage.
* Object storage - it is expected that you access them whole as a Object.

### Use cases

* good for storing images, audio and video files **instead** of expensive EC2 instance
* most of the services that consume data or ingest data, S3 would be the best option
