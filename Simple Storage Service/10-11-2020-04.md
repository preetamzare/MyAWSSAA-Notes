## S3 Storage :toolbox: Classes

### S3 Standard

* Default class i.e. data is replicated in all 3 AZs
* HTTP Response 202 (product durable uploaded in the bucket)
* CRC Checks and MD5 checksums
* Charge a dollar to transfer data outside S3 (per GB I guess), data in is free
* No retrieval fees ||  no minimum duration || no minimum size
* Strongly recommended for non-replaceable data and frequently access data.

### S3 Standard -IA (Infrequent Access)

* Half the price as S3 Standard (if S3 standard, 100 Euro, then this is 50 Euro), however Availability is same, Durability is same and can be accessible publicly
* Per request charge and transfer out,  cost is same
* Important and irreplaceable data which is **not frequently accessed.**
* But there is
  * Retrieval fee per GB plus transfer fee (?)
  * Minimum duration charge 30 days
  * Minimum size 128 KB
* Do not use it when
  * Data is frequently access
  * Lots of tiny files
  * For replaceable data (*for this S2 One Zone -IA*)
  * Unimportant (*for this S3 One Zone -IA*)
  
## S3 One Zone -IA

* Same as IA but data stays in one Zone
* Replica copies can stored in this Storage class but same "Do not use it when" consideration applies as IA

## S3 Glacier

* Costs 1/5 (100/5 = 20 Euro) of the S3 standards
* Cold objects and CAN'T be made Public
* When you retrieve job in S3 Glacier, there is naturally retrieval fee, but the object is **temporarily** moved One Zone - IA
* For permanent retrieval, we must change storage class
* Minimum size 90 KB and 90 days minimum duration
* Perfect for archival backups. These can tolerate retrieval from minutes to hours.

**S3 Glacier retrieval classes**

* **Expedited**: 1 - 5 minutes
* **Standard**: 3 - 5 hours
* **Bulk:** 5 - 12 hours
* This means first byte latency is between minutes to Hours

:electric_plug: Think of it as data can be retrieved in single shift
  
## S3 Glacier Deep Archive

* 1/4 the price of Glacier (5 Euro)
* minimum size - 40 KB and minimum duration: 180 days
* Like Glacier, objects cannot be made publicly available
* :toolbox: Usecase: Tapeouts or data which is only required for legal and compliance perspective.

:electric_plug: Think of it as data can be retrieved in two shifts

### S3 Glacier retrieval Class

* **Standard:** 12 Hours
* **Bulk:** 48 Hours

## S3 Intelligent Tiering

* After 30 days, object is moved to IA. There is minimum duration charge for 30 days
* There is no retrieval charges.
* You get charged for monitoring and automation cost per 1000 objects
* You can configured bucket, per prefix and object tags
* Bit expensive and recommended to use when you do not know the access pattern or there is change in access pattern
