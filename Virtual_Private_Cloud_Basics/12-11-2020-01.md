# Networking Refresher

* Private Address available for use in each class are
  * 10.0.0.0/8 - Class A
  * 172.16.0.0/16 - 172.31.0.0/16 -Class B
  * 192.168.0.0/24 - Class C

Rule to remember : Bigger the prefix (/32, here only one IP), smaller then network. Smaller the prefix, bigger the network (/16 here 65,000 IPs)

## Custom VPC

* Required for Hybrid networking. Default VPC do not work
* Over and above Primary IPv4 CIDR block you can create additional 5 CIDR Block
  * max /28 and min /16
* IPv6 /56 block - you can bring your own IPv6 or AWS can provide it.
* DNS comes via Route 53
* DNS address is always fixed i.e. based IP + 2
* **enableDNSSupport** (enabled by default)
* **enableDNShostnames** - to get DNS name for Public IPv4 (should be enabled.)
* Subnet and AZ have one to one relationships. Subnet once allocated to the AZ cannot be changed.
* CIDR are unique per region and cannot overlap with other AZs
* 5 IP Address in subnet are reserved by AWS
  * 0 no one can use
  * 1 is used as Gateway
  * 2 is for DNS
  * 3 is reserved
  * 4 is 255 a broadcast
* DHCP Option sets - only one at a time. cannot be edit, you can only change.
* controls DNS, NTP
* IPv4 and IPv6 public address per subnet
