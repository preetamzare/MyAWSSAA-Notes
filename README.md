# MyAWSSAA-Notes
These are notes I have created to start my Journey on AWS. 
Please, this is not my material. It is Adrian's and I have only put notes for me to review in future.
Reference: [AWS SAA Course from Adrian](https://learn.cantrill.io/) 

NB: There are many things I'm updating. Some concepts may be not as described. I have to put in my own words to understand them.
Needs to repeat but this is purely to write this note for myself so that I can consolidate my knowledge. This repository is public, in case you can benefit from it.
